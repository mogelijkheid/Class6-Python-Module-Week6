# Class6-Python-Module-Week6

## 1. Bank Project

In this project you will have 3 files:

- bank.py
- client.py
- main.py

**client.py**
- You will have class `Client` inside this file.
- Class `Client` will have `account_number`, `name`, `total_amount` attributes
- `__init__` method will initialize these variables, it will take `name` and `total_amount` as parameters and will assign a random 5 digit int to `account_number`
- Lastly this class will have `withdraw`, `deposit` and `balance` methods.

**bank.py**

- You will have class `Bank`. This bank will have instance variable `name` and class variable `clients` list. Initially this list will be empty.
- This class will have method `add_client` method which appends the client object to the list
- And lastly this class will have `authentication` method which takes `name` and `account_number` as parameters and authenticates the client

**main.py**
- This class initially will create a bank object with a name you choose and then will print the following menu (it should print this menu, until user says exit) [**hint:** use while loop]:
```
Welcome to ING!

Choose an option:

    1. Open new bank account
    2. Open existing bank account
    3. Exit
```
Then it will take the user input: 
- If it is 1, create an account
- First ask the name and then the deposit amount to user:
```
To create an account, please fill in the information below.
Name: 
Deposit amount: 
```
After this, it creates the account (**hint:** create `Client` object and append to `clients` list of `Bank`) and then prints the menu again
```
Account created successfully! Your account number is:  88194

Choose an option:

    1. Open new bank account
    2. Open existing bank account
    3. Exit
```
- If it is 2, asks following info
```
To access your account, please enter your credentials below.
Name:
Account Number:
```
- First asks name and then account number. 
- Then call the `authentication` method to check whether the client is authorized
- If credentials are wrong, print following, and then print the menu again:
```
Authentication failed!
Reason: account not found.
```
If credentials are correct, prints the following menu:
```
Authentication successful!

Welcome Irem!

Choose an option:

    1. Withdraw
    2. Deposit
    3. Balance
    4. Exit
```
And according to user input you can withdraw, deposit money. Or see the current balance. 
If input is 1, asks for withdraw amount:
```

```
And according to user input witdraws the amount and prints the menu again.
```
The sum of 100 has been withdrawn from your account balance.

Your current account balance is: 900
```
If input is 2, asks for deposit amount:
```
Deposit amount:
```
And according to user input, in this case 300. Prints following:
```
The sum of 300 has been added to your account balance.

Your current account balance is: 1200
```

If input is 3, shows the current balance:

```
Your current account balance is: 1200
```
If input is 4, it goes back to other menu.

- And lastly, in the main menu, if user input is 3: close the program
